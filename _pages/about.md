We're London Roller Derby officials that had planned on running an officials school for roller derby skaters and officials (current and new) at London Roller Derby. It was meant to be in person but due to the COVID-19 lockdown LRD officials thought take it online. This lead to a much larger response than we had originally expected and we have been running a weekly referee school to hundreds online with fellow UK referee Theminist Killjoy and a host of guests from around the world.

On this website you'll find the recorded referee school sessions and all the resources we have used each week, we hope you find it useful.

If you have any questions, please contact us at <officials@londonrollerderby.com>
