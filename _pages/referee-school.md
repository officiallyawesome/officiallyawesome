Currently, Ref School is still happening live and so join London Roller Derby’s very own Cluster Schmuck along side fellow UK ref extraordinaire, Theminist Killjoy and some amazing guest officials, for an Officially Awesome ref school. The school is open to everyone.

They will be walking you through the basics of reffing on this ten week ref school – start from “what does a roller derby track look like” – all the way through to “an eagle landed on the track and took the helmet cover – what do we do?” type scenarios.

The sessions will be held via video sessions on Zoom, so all you need is sign up here OR join our Facebook group to have the Zoom link and bring your awesome self and maybe a notebook and snacks.

The live LRD Ref school sessions ends on Sunday 14 June. But if you'd like to join the community (even past this date) - find us on Facebook and ask questions and be Officially Awesome.
