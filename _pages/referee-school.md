Welcome to the Officially Awesome Ref School.  Hosted by London Roller Derby's own Cluster Schmuck and fellow UK ref extraordinaire Theminist Killjoy, and supported by some amazing guest officials. The live LRD Ref School sessions were broadcast each Sunday for 9 weeks on Zoom and are now on YouTube for you to watch at any time, with all the resources used each week. The nine week ref school is available to anyone and walks through the basics of reffing, starting from "what does a roller derby track look like?", all the way to "an eagle landed on the track and took the helmet cover â€“ what do we do?" type scenarios.
