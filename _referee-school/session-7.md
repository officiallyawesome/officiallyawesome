Session 7 is now on YouTube!  You might want to have a look at the scenarios (linked in the resources) or pause the video after each scenario (as we have visualisations in the videos) and think about what you'd do in that situation. Let us know any thoughts and questions you've got! And as we say in the video - if you've got any scenarios you'd like us to go over next week - please do let us know at [tiny.cc/LRDRefQuestions][]{: target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"}.
