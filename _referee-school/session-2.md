- Just Dance exercises:
  - Go to YouTube and search for "Just Dance".
  - Find a video that has both a main character dancing in the screen and the little characters with symbols in the bottom right hand corner.
  - Practice and build up your ability to focus on multiple things at the same time.
  - Firstly, focusing in on the main character (or bottom left) and practise the dance a few times.
  - Then, try to see both at the same time or very close together so you're not missing a dancing beat!
  - You should notice that after a while you start to notice them more easily - but don't rush yourself. Give your brain time to adjust to focusing in on multiple things.
