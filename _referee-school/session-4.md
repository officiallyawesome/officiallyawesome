We are very excited to announce that for this week's session we have the absolutely amazing Killer Bite joining us. Kb  is a referee affiliated with London Rockin' Rollers (another wonderful London based roller derby league), and  was a Jammer Referee (with Theminist Killjoy) at WFTDA Champs 2019 and is an all around asset to European Roller Derby.

Together with Tem - we are very excited to have a session all about Jammer Reffing, a penalty we haven't spoken about much yet "cutting the track" and position (if you've ever wondered what relative or established position means - it will all become clear).
