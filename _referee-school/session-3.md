- Exercise for Session 3 (helping Pack Definition and Engagement Zone work):
  - Choose two objects (whether when you're out and about on a walk or in your house) that you think are 10ft from each other or 20 ft from each other. Then take a tape measure and see how accurate you are! OR choose one object and decide where you think 10ft/20ft is.
