A referee drill dreamt up by Xavier Bacon and Killer Bite to help improve
acceleration & footwork and challenge concentration. It will hopefully make you
sweat, curse, fall over, smile, curse again and, crucially, **get better**.

## Aims of this drill
- Improve agility and footwork
- Practice lateral movement, sharp stops and fast direction changes
- Increase awareness
- Mental challenge - different things to focus on simultaneously
- Increase your skating options and choices when reffing.

## Homework / Prep
- For best results you'll need to learn to
face the track and react by quickly
moving left, right and stopping sharply.
- Watch these for footwork inspiration:

## Our scenario...

**IMAGINE!**
- You're a JR.
- The whistle blows. The jam starts!
- Your Jammer sets off, gets stuck in the pack for a bit, being blocked, briefly recycled, attacking again.
- You keep up with the Jammer, matching their moves to watch for blocks, passes and legal re-entries.
- Then SUDDENLY the Jammer puts on a burst of speed, sets off in a sprint and earns Lead Jammer.
- You sprint too, barely needing to catch up, calling lead like a boss. Nice.
- Your Jammer completes a lap and hits the pack again
- They are bounced around a bit more before picking up a penalty, which you issue coolly and calmly.
**...keep this premise in your mind! It's our goal!**

## Start point
{% include figure image_path="https://res.cloudinary.com/officially-awesome/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/officially-awesome/screenshots/keeping-up-with-reaper-3_sdjy6k.png" alt="" caption="" %}

- This is your setup →
- **Four cones**, starting at the Pivot Line, then 5ft-ish apart - they simulate a Pack of sorts.
  - They are mentally **numbered 1, 2, 3, 4**
- One ref is in position as if they are a **JR** ready at jam start.
- Others form a **queue** in the centre, hugging the centre to keep away from where the JR might skate.
- The first one in the line who's next up to JR is the **Caller**.
(If you have space but no track access, mark out the distances in a spare bit of space, and substitute sprints to the wall, touch & back, situps etc. instead of laps around. We designed this drill without a track originally!)
**...now choose your level!**

## Level One - Skills & Sprint
{% include figure image_path="https://res.cloudinary.com/officially-awesome/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/officially-awesome/screenshots/keeping-up-with-reaper-4_pgg7xy.png" alt="" caption="" %}

- Caller and JR agree a difficulty, expressed as a number.
  - **Start with 4 to begin with**.
- Caller blows Jam Start Whistle.
- JR sets off - as JR approaches the 'Pack', Caller calls out cone numbers in sequence, until they've called as many as the difficulty level.
- Allow the JR to *almost* reach each then call the next number right away.
- Don't let the JR come to a halt, keep them moving, but don't call so fast they can't keep up - work together!
- The JR's aim is to stop in line with the cone number called and react to move quickly to the next one. Finish with "GO!"
  - e.g. illustrated here **"Three! Two! Four! One! GO!"**
- On hearing "GO!" the JR must signal Lead Jammer (full whistles and signals) whilst **accelerating** rapidly.
- JR joins the back of the queue, new JR, new Caller, repeat...

## Level Two - Second Pass & Penalty
{% include figure image_path="https://res.cloudinary.com/officially-awesome/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/officially-awesome/screenshots/keeping-up-with-reaper-5_gyda0r.png" alt="" caption="" %}

- As per Level One… start whistle, set off, call out cone numbers...
- ...but this time on "GO!" the JR accelerates and completes a full lap, they don't stop and join the queue.
- When they approach the Pack for a second time, the Caller calls a second sequence of numbers, this time finishing with "Penalty!" instead of "GO!"
  - e.g. as illustrated here **"One! Two! One! Three! Penalty!"**
- On hearing "Penalty!", the JR must signal a penalty of their choice on their imaginary Jammer.
- JR joins back of line, new JR, new Caller, repeat...

## Hard Mode - Actual Live Jammer
{% include figure image_path="https://res.cloudinary.com/officially-awesome/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/officially-awesome/screenshots/keeping-up-with-reaper-6_mjucai.png" alt="" caption="" %}

- As per Level Two, EXCEPT that instead of a Caller, you have a skater or ref be an Actual Live Jammer, and you have to match their skating
instead of listen out for which marker to hit.
- You still agree a difficulty level (i.e. 4 as before), then the Jammer skates and stops/changes direction to hit the marks quickly.
- This is a proper challenge as you have to watch as well as keep up, not just hear and anticipate. It's closer to the real gameday challenge.
- Do the accelerate-to-sprint, Lead Jammer signal, lap round, pack re-entry, second round and penalty as per Level Two.
- Switch up and repeat...

## Bonus Stage!

Ways to make the drill harder:
- Increase Difficulty setting - agree to hit 6 cones, 8 cones, 10 cones (I like 10)
- Do more laps
- Call cone numbers faster to increase urgency of direction changes
- Wear a Jammer Identifier wristband so you have a colour to remember and call, not just pure imagination (you'll forget it, trust me...).
- ‘God Mode' - two JRs and two Callers at the same time, without whoever hears GO! first calling Lead Jammer.
- Make the JR memorise the sequence upfront rather than call out so they have to remember - penalise if they screw up and forget (situps/plank/etc).
- **Play around…** let me know of other variations you come up with!

**DON'T move cones further apart** - this is about sharp stops / quick direction changes. Wider spacing allows sloppy skating.
