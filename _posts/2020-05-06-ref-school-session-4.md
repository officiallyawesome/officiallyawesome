## Session 4 is this Sunday 10 May!
Thank you to all those who joined us for Session 3 last week - it was a fun session all about the engagement zone and pack definition (who would have thought you'd receive an email in 2020 that said "fun" and "pack definition" in the same sentence).

## Guest Referee for Session 4!

We are very excited to announce that for this week's session we have the absolutely amazing Killer Bite joining us. Kb  is a referee affiliated with London Rockin' Rollers (another wonderful London based roller derby league), and  was a Jammer Referee (with Theminist Killjoy) at WFTDA Champs 2019 and is an all around asset to European Roller Derby.

Together with Tem - we are very excited to have a session all about Jammer Reffing, a penalty we haven't spoken about much yet "cutting the track" and position (if you've ever wondered what relative or established position means - it will all become clear).

[Note from Cluster:  Jammer Reffing isn't something I've done a lot of and so I'm SUPER excited for this week to learn from two of the best Jammer Refs in the world IMO!]

## Update from the poll last week

The result of the poll from last week (around the length of  the session) means we are continuing to have one hour long session and now adding at the end 30 minutes of questions.

- Main session: 3-4pm (BST)
- Questions: 4-4.30pm (BST)

You can obviously still ask questions throughout the session but we hope this will help with the fact that usually in a ref school you'd have more time. And particularly, more time to go through some of the nuance and questions that come into your mind when thinking about so much new information.

## Recording: Session 3

The video will go up on YouTube within 24 hours of the session. We are then asking members of the community to add accurate subtitles, which will take a few days. We can’t guarantee YouTube automated ones will be good. For folks who weren’t in the session there was a very active chat thread. If you've got any questions please let us know - either on Facebook, YouTube comments or email us.
